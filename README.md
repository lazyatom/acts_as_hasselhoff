# Acts As Hasselhoff

![The Hoff](http://i.imgur.com/mwWGDL3.jpg)

Your application is now powered by HOFF!!!

CAUTION: with great chest hair comes great responsibility.

## Installation

Add this line to your Rails application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'acts_as_hasselhoff'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

Once the gem is part of your Rails app it's pretty simple to use.

Just find a model you would like to have act as Hasselhoff and add:

```ruby
# app/models/post.rb

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_hasselhoff
end
```

Now go save a `Post`.

## The Truth

The hoff idea was stolen from [James Adam](http://lazyatom.com/)'s original [acts_as_hasselhoff plugin](https://github.com/lazyatom/acts_as_hasselhoff). I felt the burning need to make it work with Rails 4 and above, so, here it is. James fully approves of the continuation of this lunacy.
